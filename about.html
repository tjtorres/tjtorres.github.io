<p>Currently I am a physics PhD student at UC Santa Cruz, slated to graduate June 2015. This blog represents some of my work and thoughts on Data Science and Machine Learning subjects as I transition into this new field. I'll try to keep it updated as I come accross topics I find interesting, or finish working on new projects.</p>

<p>Additionally, even if I don't explicitly reference it in the post, most of my code mentioned here (including the code for this blog) will be available on my <a href='https://github.com/tjtorres'>GitHub page</a>.</p> 

<p>If you'd like to get in touch with me, or have questions/comments on these posts, I am easily reachable though the form on the contact page.</p>
